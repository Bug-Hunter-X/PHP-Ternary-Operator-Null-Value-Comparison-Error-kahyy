This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to the usage of the ternary operator and its interaction with variable assignments.  The issue stems from the operator's precedence and how PHP handles assignments within the conditional expression. 
```php
$value = isset($_GET['param']) ? $_GET['param'] : null;
$result = $value === null ? 'Param is not set' : 'Param is set: ' . $value;
echo $result;
```
In this example, if `$_GET['param']` is not set, the `$value` variable will be `null`. However, the next ternary operation will not produce the intended output if `$value` is a string that happens to be 'null'. The intended behavior is to check if the variable is the actual `null` value. 
The problem lies in comparing `$value` with the string 'null' instead of the null value itself.
