The solution corrects the comparison to explicitly check for the null value using the strict equality operator (`===`). 
```php
$value = isset($_GET['param']) ? $_GET['param'] : null;
$result = $value === null ? 'Param is not set' : 'Param is set: ' . $value;
echo $result;
```
This ensures that the comparison is done correctly, avoiding any unintended string comparison and ensuring that only an actual null value triggers the 'Param is not set' message. The strict comparison operator (`===`) ensures type safety, preventing any false positives that could occur when comparing against the string 'null'.
This revised code accurately reflects the intent and resolves the issue of unexpected behavior when dealing with null values within a ternary operation.

The corrected code always compares against `null` using strict equality (`===`) rather than relying on loose equality (`==`), which might lead to unexpected results when comparing different data types.
